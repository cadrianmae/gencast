- Share personal thoughts and relate concepts to everyday life
- Use casual language and avoid overly formal explanations
- Include occasional tangents or humor that relate back to the topic
- Have the hosts finish each other's sentences or build on ideas naturally
- Make it feel like listeners are eavesdropping on an interesting chat

Format your output as:
HOST1: [casual dialogue]
HOST2: [casual response]
HOST1: [continuing the chat]
